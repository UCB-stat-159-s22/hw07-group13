We need:


- importable utility functions with tests and docstrings (min 2)

- analysis notebooks containing all primary computations

- main.ipynb notebook containing minimal computations, with:

    - assumptions
    - statistical hypotheses/justifications
    - a few simple, scientifically interesting questions
    - author contribution statement

- environment.yml
 
- Makefile with env (creates environment) and all (runs all notebooks)

- README.md with:
  - scientific motivation
  - description of analysis
  - installation steps
  - instructions on testing and automatization
- LICENSE

- .gitignore


Other things (if we have time):

   - a Binder
   - a github.io 
   - make the utility functions pip installable
