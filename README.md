# Exploring the Air Quality of the San Francisco Bay Area using OpenAQ #
***
This repo houses the materials for a reproducible project report exploring air quality in the San Francisco Bay Area. Using the publicly-accessible data on [OpenAQ](https://openaq.org/#/), we explored and visualized the air quality on the days surrounding the Bay Area's infamous "Dark Day" (September 9th, 2020), and used multiple statistical learning techniques to develop a potential model for predicting future "dark days" and to predict the amount of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) in the air given the presence of other air pollutants, as it is a particularly dangerous

To 
We need:


- analysis notebooks containing all primary computations

- main.ipynb notebook containing minimal computations, with:

    - assumptions
    - statistical hypotheses/justifications
    - a few simple, scientifically interesting questions
    - author contribution statement

- environment.yml
 
- Makefile with env (creates environment) and all (runs all notebooks)

- README.md with:
  - scientific motivation
  - description of analysis
  - installation steps
  - instructions on testing and automatization
- LICENSE

- .gitignore


Other things (if we have time):

   - a Binder
   - a github.io 
   - make the utility functions pip installable
